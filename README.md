#### About me: :star:
So as you probably already understand my name is Noa and I am 25 years old. I'm a Motivated Tel Aviv University Labor Studies & Communications alumnus skilled in Python, SQL, Data Analytics and Excel. A responsible and organized individual with strong problem solving, interpersonal and management skills. âœ¨

I started my learning journey in she code; and since then I have expanded it on Codecademy. I took a few courses there and I have learned Python and SQL in addition to my previous knowledge in Excel. 
I have learned how to analyze data using Python and SQL. Here's some of the things I like doing:
- Manipulating data using NumPy and Pandas
- Visualizing data using Matplotlib and seaborn
- Summarizing and analyzing data with scikit-learn

Here you will be able to find some projects I have done recently, I hope you like them.
